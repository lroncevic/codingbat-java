Given 2 non-negative ints, a and b, return their sum, so long as the sum has the same number of digits as a. If the sum has more digits than a, just return a without b. (Note: one way to compute the number of digits of a non-negative int n is to convert it to a string with String.valueOf(n) and then check the length of the string.)


sumLimit(2, 3) → 5
sumLimit(8, 3) → 8
sumLimit(8, 1) → 9

public int sumLimit(int a, int b) {
  int sum = a + b;
  int num1 = String.valueOf(a).length();
  int digitNum = String.valueOf(sum).length();
  
  return(digitNum > num1) ? a : sum;
}
